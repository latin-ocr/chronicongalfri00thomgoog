who was a well-wisher, if not also a dependent of the 'same powersul
house.

The Cotton MS. does not appear to have formed any part of the
Cottonian library, as catalogued. It was found among the burnt MSS.
which suffered in the disastrous fire of 1731 at Ashbumham House,
westminster. lt now consists os 22 leaves of vellum, which measure
generally about 9l by 6} inches‚ the earlier leaves being rather smaller

and more shrunken by the action of the fire, and the first half of the
⁰ whole number beinga good deal damaged and defaced. The writing is
of the latter part os the fourteenth century, perhaps os about the year
1370. lt contains, as already noticed,a partos Baker²s chronicle for
the reign of Edward the third only, and it probably never contained
the earlier reign, sor the condition of the first page, worn and desaced,
is not that of one which has had the protection os leaves preceding it.
Moreover, the text begins at the top of the page and with a decorated
initial letter, as in the case of an independent work. All these circum·
stances point to the omission, srom the first, os the history of Edward
the second's reign; and support the suggestion, put forward above,
that the two reigns were sometimes transcribed as separate works in
different MSS.

The reason for this rather unusual proceeding is, l think, to be
found in the arrangement of the text of the beginning os Edward the
third's reign in the Bodley MS. Here we have, sor the first three
yearS, two versions (see pp. 34-43 below), the second written imme·
diately after the first. The second version is that which appears in the
Cotton MS. It would seem, then, that Baker, after bringing his chron-
icle to its present conclusion under the year 1356, intended to revise,
or rewrite, his history os Edward the third„and that he had actually
commenced the work when, probably, death overtook him. For it
'will be‘seen from his concluding words (p. 155) that he was then
writing as late as 1358, and, as the copy in the Bodley MS, the
‘unrevised work of a careless transcriber, was written in or soon aster
