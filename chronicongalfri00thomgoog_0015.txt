vi PREFACE.

.. The larger chronicle is also the work of Baker. Of this there
¹ can be no doubt, although his name does not appear in any part
of it. Not only is the work found in company with the ‘chroniculum'
in the Bodley MS., but also in a certain passage the author addresses
sir Thomas de la More, the same knight at whose nequest Baker had
written the shorter work in 1347.

The occurrence of dela More’s name has been the cause of
depriving Baker of the honour of the authorship of at least a part
of his work. For his history of Edward the second’s reign came,
by some accident, to be attributed to his patron, and has been quoted
under the good knight’s name bya s'uccession of writers. Towards
the close of the sixteenth century this portion of Bakers chronicle
appears to have become popular by the dissemination of copies, tran·
scribed, apparently with some abridgment and alterations, from MSS.

· ·’ now lost. The title which these transcripts bore was: ‘Vita et Mors

Edwardi secundi, Gallice conscripta a generosissimo milite, Thoma de
la Moore.' l think‘fhaffhe‘fe'can be little doubt that they were

taken from MSS. which contained Baker’s chronicle of Edward the
’ second's reign only. Had MSS. (such as the Bodley MS. of our
text) containing the whole chronicle and the ‘chroniculum' also been
used, the attribution to sir Thomas de la More could hardly have
been put forward, with the evidence of Baker’s authorship so
manifest. And further, the condition of the Cotton MS, presently
to be described, which has the text of Edward the third's reign
only, copied apparently as a separate chronicle, favours the view of
« the two reigns having been in some copies treated as two distinct
works.

The ‘Vita et Mors' was first printed by Camden in his Anglica,
Normanm'ca, Hibernica, etc, in 1603 ; and it has recently had the
benefit of being re·edited by the Bishop of Oxford ¹. Referring to the
