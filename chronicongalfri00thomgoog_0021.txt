F rance and the battle of Crecy; the battle os Neville’s Cross; the ’
siege and fall of Calais; the Black Death; the foundation of the order
os the Garter; the sea-fight with the Spaniards off Winchelsea; the
duel os Thomas de la Marche; the capture ol Guines castle; the battle
of Mauron; the duke ol Lancaster's single combat with Otho of
⁴Brunswick; the Black Prince's march from Bordeaux to Narbonne
and back, the route being described with a fulness which is found in
no other writer; and, lastly, the battle of Poitiers, the details of which
are set forth with remarkable precision. Baker's history os these ·
events was drawn upon, to no small extent, by the historian Stow,
who has imported into the 1605 edition os his Annales translations,
more or less correct, of many long passages. And through this
medium much os Baker's narrative has found its way into more
recent works.

The two MSS. which have been used sor the present edition are
the only known copieso of the chronicle‚ viz Weff ψῃ ἑιι and
Cotton MS. Appendix ιιι. The former contains t ec oni eand
the-‘chroniculum'; the latter, a portion only ol the chronicle ol the
reign os Edward the third. The text in the Bodley MS. was printed
in 1847 by Dr. Giles, as one' of the publications of the Caxton Society.
Giles made use os a transcript; his work was imperfectly performed ;
and there is very good reason lor believing that he never saw the
original MS. at all.
