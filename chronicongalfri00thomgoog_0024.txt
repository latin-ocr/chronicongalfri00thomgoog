which forms a partos the original contents, was in 1328 presented to
the rectory of Shenlieldin Essex, and again in 1334 to the rectory of
lees Magna or Much bees in the same county, byJ0hn de Bohun,
carl of Hereford, who died in 1335. Walmesford then, was evidently
a dependent, in some way, of the family, and if, as seems not improb-
able, the MS. was originally compiled for him, itis no matter for
surprise that he should have included in it a chronicle written by one
