PREFACE.

>⁴⁴—

Tuc authorship of the chronicle and ‘chroniculum' which are
printed in this volume is disclosed in the colophon of the smaller work
fp.173). The writer, Geoffrey le Baker, of Swinbroolr, an Oxford·
shire village lying two miles east of Burford, there tells us that he
wrote, or rather finished writing, this little chronicle at Osney on
Friday, the festival of St. Margaret [aoth July], 1347 ; and that the
work was done at the request of sir Thomas de la More, knight.
The ‘chroniculum’ has no other historical importance. Itis a jejune
record of events, beginning with the six days of creation, the ages
of the world, and a few notes of early history, and proceeding with
two short series in chronological sequence: the first from the birth of
Our Lord to the year 1320, touching chiefly on matters of ecclesias·
tical history and ending with the succession of bishops of certain
English sees (pp. 158-164); the other beginning with the death of
Augustus, but immediately passing on to events in English history
down to the year 1336-7 (pp. 164-173l· The dates of the entries
in both series are calculated both in the ordinary manner by the year
of Our Lord, and also back from the year of compilation, 1347. Baker
styles himself ‘clericus ’; but by this term he probably does not mean
that he was a canon of Osney. Had he been one of the brethren of
that house, we might expect that he would have found room in his
brief record for more notes connected with the abbey than he has
done. Only in two places does he mention Osney: the one referring
to the benefactions of John de Pagham, bishop of Worcester (p. 163),
the other to the burial of Ela, countess of Warwick (p. 169). '
