identified with the patron os Geoffrey le Baker. lshall not venture to ’ μ’

identify him with sir Thomas dela More who in 1370 was constable
or vice-warden os Porchester Castle under the earl os Arundel,
although, supposing him to have been a young esquire -in the service
of bishop Stratford in 1326, he may easily be supposed to have survived
until the close ol the reign of Edward iii’ ¹.

Whether 'Baker was a tenant or some such dependent os his
patron is now beyond our power to show; but itis more than probable
that the family ol de la More had land in, or in the immediate neigh-
bourhood os, Swinbrook‚ and that the chronicler held some relation ol
this kind towards the reverend knight ².

There was also a greater Oxfordshire family than the de la Mores
with whom Baker seems to have had some connection. The BohunS,

earls os Herelord, were lords o sthe hundred os Chadlington, Μ

² A curious piece of evidence showing that, at a later period, at least one ol the family
was in possession ol landon the very borders of Swinbrook parish hasbeen kindly
communicated to me by the Bishop of Oxtord. lt consists ol the following memorandum
oi ownersbip, written in a copy ol Bishop Hall's Explicatr'on os all the hard texts os thr
Old and New Testamenta, which was quoted in a second-hand bookseller's catalogue last

year: “Thomas More de la More dwelleth in Pagan’s Court in Teynton nere Swinbroke
and Burlord, in Oxlordshire, Nov. 1652. Cornet to Tho. Faimax, 1647.'' The village of

Taynton lies a mile on the western side ol Bursord‚ while Swinbrook lies to the cast ; but
there is an outlying portion ol Taynton parish close to Swinbrook, and at the very
southern extremity of it is ‘⁶ Pain’s Farm,” just hall a mile north of the village. This,
1 baveno doubt, is the “ Pagan's Court ’' where dwelt Fairlax's quondam comet. Thus
the names ol More and Swinbrook are once more brought together some three centuriea
