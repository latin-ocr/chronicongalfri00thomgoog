We may then be grateful sor the preservation ol so much that is
of the greatest historical interest, and may also acknowledge a debt to
Murimuth, feeling that, had his chronicle not existed, we might have
lost the superstructure of Bakeffs picturesque descriptions; but the
enjoyment is marred by the pedantic craze ol the elder chronicler for

making his historic year begin at Michaelmas, which his younger con·
temporary blindly adopts. Baker was certainly not strong in chron·
ology. He evidently did not write his work from year to year. As
already stated, he used an epition ol Murimuth which ends 'n Ιῇῑς
and he says that e a the storyo war tesecon spe ron
from William Bishop aster the occurrence of ‘magna pestilencia,' the
Black Death, in 1348-9. lt would appear then that he certainly did
not commence his chronicle until alter 1341, to which period he accepts
Murimuth's dates without question, and that he may not have begun
before the middle os the century. As evidence that he did not write
with regularity, it will be noticed that in several instances he seems to
have mixed the various information which he had gathered from eye·
- witnesses of different events some time alter they had taken place. For
example, he confuses the campaign in Brittany of 1342 (dating it 1344)
with that of 1345 ¹, and other similar confusions are pointed out in the

notes.

. of which ssaker’s chronicle is of special value. They are: the battle

os Bannockbum; queen lsabella's invasion os England, her intrigues,
and the fall ol Edward the second; his persecution and his murder;
the ignominious treaty with the Scots in 1328, the earl of Kent’s
restoration plot; the sall ol Mortimer; the battle of Halidon Hill; the
battle os Sluys ; the march ol Edward the third through the north of
